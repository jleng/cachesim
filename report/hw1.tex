\section{Evaluation}
\subsection{Single Cache}
\label{single_cache}
To test our single cache (core) version of the cache simulator, we generate the memory access trace for program shown in \Fig{fig:autotest}, which uses a fixed stride to access an array (each element is one byte). 

\begin{figure}[ht]
\lstinputlisting[language=C]{figs/autotest.cpp}
\caption{Program to automatically test cache paramters.}
\label{fig:autotest}
\end{figure}

\Fig{fig:autotest_result} shows the results for the program with different array size and stride mentioned previously. We consider this is the signature dictionary of our cache. Next, we are going to explain how to get the cache parameters through the graph. We have also tested the scenario with L2 cache disable, but we only show the results for the single case with both L1 and L2 cache. Parameters for both cache are shown in the Figure.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\begin{minipage}[b]{\textwidth}
 \centering
 \includegraphics[trim=0mm 0mm 0mm 0mm,clip,width=\linewidth]{figs/autotest.pdf}
 \caption{Average memory access cycles for different array size and stride.}
 \label{fig:autotest_result}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Hit/Miss Latency}
\Fig{fig:autotest_result} shows the average memory access cycles for different scenarios, i.e. L1 hit, L1 miss but L2 hit and L2 miss. The average access cycles for these scenarios are 5, 25 an 225 respectively. 

\paragraph{Cache Capacity}
As shown in the \Fig{fig:autotest_result}, when the array size is 16KB and 32KB, the array size is smaller or equal than the L1 cache capacity (32KB in the Figure). Thus the L1 cache is able to hold the whole array, which result in always L1 hit (except the initial cold miss). Similarly, for array size 64KB, 128KB and 256KB, which are smaller or equal than the L2 capacity 256KB but bigger than the L1 cache capacity, the access is L1 miss but L2 hit. When the array size is bigger than both L1 and L2 size, the memory access will be miss in the L2 cache.

\paragraph{Block Size}
As shown in the \Fig{fig:autotest_result}, when the stride to access memory changes from 8~$(2^3)$~Bytes to 16~$(2^4)$~Bytes, the memory access result in completely L1 miss. This is because the L1 cache block size is 16~Bytes. Access stride bigger than the block size would result in the completely L1 miss. Similarly, the transition point for L2 miss when access stride is 128~$(2^7)$~Bytes matches the L2 cache block size (128~Bytes).

\paragraph{Cache Associativity}
In the \Fig{fig:autotest_result}, when the access stride to access memory changes from $(2^{14})$~Bytes to $(2^{15})$~Bytes at array size 64KB, the memory access changes from L1 miss to L1 hit, although the array size is bigger than the L1 cache size. When the array size is 64KB ($2^{16}$~Bytes) and access stride is $(2^{14})$~Bytes, the program shown in \Fig{fig:autotest} is only accessing four elements in the array (with index 0, 16KB, 32KB and 64KB). However, these addresses have same index and the associativity for L1 cache is 2, each access is suffering conflict miss. When access stride becomes $2^{15}$~Bytes, which is the half size of the array, the program is only accessing two elements in the array. Although they still access the same set in the cache, associativity 2 is enough to guarantee cache his in this scenario. This also applies the array size 128KB and 256KB. For the L2 cache, the transition point for array size 512KB, 1024KB and 2048KB matches the L2 associativity as well.

\subsection{Multicore Cache}

In this homework, the L1 cache is private for each core, thus there is no difference between single core and multi core version. The main difference between these two scenarios come from the L2 cache: it can be equally partitioned, unequally partitioned or shared by all cores. \Sec{single_cache} already focuses on the evaluation of the cache hierarchies. Thus for the multicore cache part, we only focus on the evaluation of different L2 partition/shared cases.

\paragraph{Partitioned L2 Cache}
Typically L2 cache has multiple banks with one read port and one write port to achieve the same effect with a large L2 cache with multiple read/write ports, but with much less area/power overhead. When the L2 cache is partitioned among multiple cores, each core will be assigned with multiple banks that are dedicated to serve that core. The number of L2 cache banks assigned to each core can be equal or unequal. In the partitioned L2 cache, a core is not allowed to access banks assigned to other cores. To validate this property, we first simulate the scenario that four different traces are assigned to four different cores. Then we feed only one trace. (empty traces are fed to other cores)

\end{figure}

\Tbl{bank_isolation} shows the result for the bank access isolation test. We used equally partitioned L2 cache for four cores, and each core is assigned with 4 banks. The first two columns of the Table show how banks are assigned to each core. The other columns show the access counts to each bank under different cases. In the \emph{Four Traces} scenario, \emph{gcc} trace is fed to core 0, \emph{dealII} trace is for 1, \emph{mcf} for core 2 and \emph{soplex} for core 3. In the \emph{gcc Core 0} case, gcc trace is fed to core 0 and other cores are fed with a "pseudo" empty trace with only one memory access (that's why other cores have one access in the L2), similarly for other three scenarios. The access counts in \Tbl{bank_isolation} show that in the partitioned case, a core is not able to access other cores' banks.

\paragraph{Shared L2 Cache}
In shared L2 cache, each core is free to access any bank. Here, we compare the metric of \emph{Average Memory Access Time} (AMAT) for the shared L2 cache with partitioned L2 cache.


We used 16-banked L2 cache for 4 cores. The trace fed to each core is the same in the third column of \Tbl{bank_isolation}. \Fig{bank_hit} shows the hit rate for each bank for different schemes. For equal partitioned, we can clearly see core 0 and core 1 have the highest bank hit while core 3 has the lowest hit rate. In the shared L2 cache scheme, each bank has a more evenly distributed bank hit rate. With the knowledge that core 3 has the lowest hit rate, we increase the number of banks assigned to core 3 to 8 (resulting the bank allocation for each core 2 2 4 8, still 16 total banks). The result in \Fig{bank_hit} shows the improvement of bank hit rate for core 3. Core 0 and core 1 are not affected that much since they don not have the desire to a larger cache.

 \label{bench_stats}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

\Fig{bench_stats} shows the AMAT for each benchmark. We can see the shared L2 cache and the unequal partitioned L2 cache with the knowledge of benchmark characteristics can reduce the AMAT for benchmark \emph{soplex} without affecting other program's performance, resulting a smaller AMAT averaged for these 4 benchmarks.
